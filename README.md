# 2nd Task: Image Encryption/Decryption Program

As part of my second assignment during the internship at Prodigy InfoTech, I developed a simple Python program that encrypts and decrypts images using pixel manipulation. The program swaps pixel values to encrypt the image and then swaps them back to decrypt it. This project was developed as part of an internship at Prodigy InfoTech.

## Overview

The program uses basic pixel manipulation techniques to perform the encryption and decryption of images. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt images by swapping the red and blue channels of each pixel.

## Features

- **Encryption**: Encrypts an image by swapping the red and blue channels of each pixel.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts an image by swapping the red and blue channels of each pixel back to their original positions.
- **User Input**: Prompts the user to specify the input image path, output image path, and optionally a key (not used in the current implementation).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow (PIL) library
